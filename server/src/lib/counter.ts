/**
 * Counter Engine v0 — CounterEngine.md build order steps 2 and 6.
 *
 * NUMBERING NOTE for the next reader: there are 5 rounds in CounterEngine.md's
 * internal numbering (R1-R5, R4 skipped here) but only 3 user-facing panels.
 * R3 (graph attacks) is not its own panel — it folds into the 'opposing'
 * RoundResult per §5.3's `mergeOpposing`, because "an attack on an authority
 * you're relying on" is exactly the kind of thing the other side would raise.
 * So: R1 -> 'supporting' panel. R2 + R3 -> 'opposing' panel (R3 items carry
 * `viaGraph: true` to stay distinguishable). R5 -> 'statutes' panel. Do not
 * go looking for a fourth or fifth RoundResult — there are only three.
 *
 * Four rounds are implemented, R4 is not:
 *
 *   R1 supporting  — wraps searchCases() (lib/search.ts). No new retrieval.
 *   R2 opposing    — the §11 v0 fallback: vector search on `chunks` filtered
 *                    to section_primary "submissions", joined to `paragraphs`
 *                    for kanoon_structure. The `arguments` collection this
 *                    would eventually query does not exist (ARGUMENTS.md
 *                    Stages B/C unbuilt), so these items are UNLABELLED —
 *                    `stanceUndetermined: true`, never a fabricated stance.
 *   R3 attacks     — pure graph, no embedding: edges with polarity neg/mixed
 *                    pointing at an R1 authority, plus the paragraph that did
 *                    the disagreeing. Folded into 'opposing' (see above), each
 *                    flagged `viaGraph: true` with `becauseOf` set — an
 *                    unexplained graph result is worse than no result
 *                    (GRAPH_RETRIEVAL.md).
 *   R5 statutes    — a PINNED map of hand-verified chunk ids (STATUTE_CHUNK
 *                    below), only when offenceCategory !== 'ordinary'. Not a
 *                    search of any kind, on purpose: an earlier BM25 version
 *                    of this round returned UAPA s.43D(5) text for an NDPS
 *                    query, because both statutes' twin-condition clauses
 *                    share almost all their vocabulary ("reasonable grounds
 *                    for believing... not guilty... not likely to commit").
 *                    Verified directly against the corpus (2026-09-07): NDPS
 *                    s.37 and UAPA s.43D(5) are both genuinely present and
 *                    now pinned; PMLA s.45 and Companies Act s.212(6) are
 *                    NOT present anywhere in these 198 judgments as bare
 *                    quoted text (only as court paraphrase of what counsel
 *                    argued, which is not the same thing) — those categories
 *                    return an empty round rather than the wrong Act's text.
 *                    Returning nothing is recoverable; returning the wrong
 *                    provision, presented under a STATUTE badge, is not.
 *
 * R4 (rebuttals) is explicitly out of scope for this build: it needs
 * `outcome` labels ARGUMENTS.md Stage C has not produced yet.
 *
 * Plain JSON response, not SSE — streaming is a later step (build order 4).

 * reading the full chunk text and, where available, the court's own next
 * paragraph explicitly naming the Act and section:
 *
 *   ndps  -- 26003907_c001 (Satpal Singh v State of Punjab, 2018), the
 *            complete NDPS s.37(1)(b) twin-condition clause plus s.37(2).
 *            The very next chunk in that judgment (26003907_c002) opens
 *            "Under Section 37 of the NDPS Act..." -- unambiguous.
 *   uapa  -- 117627977_c032 (NIA v Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali, 2019), s.43D(5)
 *            in full: "no person accused... shall, if in custody, be
 *            released on bail... unless the Public Prosecutor has been
 *            given an opportunity of being heard...".
 *
 * NOT pinned, and deliberately empty rather than guessed:
 *
 *   pmla  -- searched the whole corpus (every chunk containing "Section 45"
 *            or "money laundering") and found no chunk that quotes the bare
 *            provision. tid 3764 (Union of India v Hassan Ali Khan)
 *            discusses s.45 at length but only as the court paraphrasing
 *            what the ASG argued ("the learned ASG also referred to the
 *            provisions of Section 45...") -- correctly content_type
 *            court_text, and not the same thing as the provision's actual
 *            words. Presenting that paraphrase under a STATUTE badge would
 *            misattribute it.
 *   economic / other_special -- no Companies Act s.212(6) text, or any
 *            single canonical provision, found anywhere in the corpus.
 *
 * Add an id here only after doing the same verification -- read the full
 * chunk, and ideally find corroborating text nearby that names the Act and
 * section number in so many words. A wrong id here is worse than a missing
 * one: it hands the user a real quotation under a STATUTE badge that is
 * quietly the wrong law.
